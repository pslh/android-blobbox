Blobbox Remote by Rodolfo Saccani and Paul Henshaw
 
Blobbox Remote is an Android application providing "second-screen" integration 
with a Blobbox (http://www.blobbox.tv/).

Insert the IP address of your Blobbox and optionally username and password 
specified in the Blobbox remote access settings.

Find links to network audio/video content in the browser or other applications
(youtube, BBC news etc.).  When you click on a suitable link, you will be
presented with a menu offering to play the content on the Blobbox or to 
have the Blobbox download it.
